# IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository focuses on performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IPL (Indian Premier League) dataset. The analysis includes various components such as Matches Analysis and Deliveries Analysis. By leveraging these techniques, we can gain valuable insights into player performance, team statistics, match outcomes, and trends. The findings from this analysis can be used to inform strategic decisions, enhance cricket analytics, and understand the dynamics of the IPL.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the IPL dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

- **Matches Analysis**: Perform analysis on match-related data, including team performances, match results, venue analysis, and player statistics. Gain insights into winning patterns, run rates, and team strategies.

- **Deliveries Analysis**: Analyze individual deliveries data to uncover player performance metrics such as runs scored, wickets taken, batting strike rates, and bowling economy rates. Understand player contributions and identify key performers.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conduct comprehensive analysis of the IPL dataset using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis. Explore relationships between variables and identify interesting trends or patterns.

## Usage
